It should fetch the latest release from the GitHub API (repo: the zeit repository), compare the version tag against the current app version, and inform the user if an update is available with a download link. Use URLSession for the HTTP request. Add the command as a subcommand of the root ZeitCLI in ZeitCLI.swift.",
