- memory use optimization: right now it occupies 18.5 GB of RAM
- are models loaded on demand or once at startup?
- more fine grained activity identification (e.g. capture the jira tickets I've been working on)
- sample screenshots and eval
- eval basic stuff , e.g. it works on multiple screens, identifying the active one...
- a tool to help in the evaluation process:
  - maybe should allow sampling, say 5 screenshots per hour during a day.
- How can we support out of work tracking? 
  - The objective would be to track how you spend your time outside of work, maybe in side projects or personal projects. How can we design this?
