This will enhance the user experience by providing feedback on the status of their model downloads, especially since these can take some time. The notification should be triggered once the model download process is finished, and it should include relevant information such as the name of the downloaded model and any next steps the user might need to take.",

Instead It should open a single window, maybe with some tabs on the left. The tabs should be: permissions, models, debug and about tab. The permissions tab should show that the user has granted the permissions and should not be editable. The models tab should show the models that they have downloaded. The debug tab should allow enabling the debug mode.",
